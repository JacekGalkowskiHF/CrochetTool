stitch creation sequence notation

definition format:
NAME : (arg1 | null ) [arg2 [arg 3 [arg 4 ..]]]

RULE 1: all newly created nodes and links are registered in the context stitch and its project
RULE 2: "stack" contains both the commands as well as the stitches worked on the "needle"
RULE 3: "queue" contains all stitches passed to the constructor as "argOtherHooksÄ™ 

MAKE NODE_TYPE
1. X :=  new stitchNode of type NODE_TYPE
2. pushes X to needle

TAKE null
1. x := pops a stitchNode form the queue
2. pushes X to needle

FWD LINK_TYPE NODE_TYPE
1. X := pop a stitch  form needle
2. Y := new stitchNode of type NODE_TYPE
3. L := new stitchLink of type NODE_TYPE between X and Y (from X to Y)
4. push Y to needle

BCK LINK_TYPE NODE_TYPE
same as "FWD" but the link is form Y to X (but still only Y is pushed to stack)

SAVE
1. X := pops a stitchNode form the queue
2. pushes X (reference) to queue
3. pushes X (back) to needle

LEFT
1. X := pop a stitch  form needle
2. Y := pop a stitch  form needle
3. merge X into Y
4. push Y to needle

RIGHT
1. X := pop a stitch  form needle
2. Y := pop a stitch  form needle
3. merge Y into X
4. push X to needle
